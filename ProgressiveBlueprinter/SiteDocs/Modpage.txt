## Progressive Blueprinters
  
Have you ever wanted to start with blueprints early, but was overwhelmed by the size?  
Or needed a small print made on location and struggled to find a place to put large blueprint machine down?  
Or perhaps wanted to go slightly larger without it feeling cheaty?  
We got you covered.

With **Fix-It Ltd.** Progressive Blueprinter Pack, you can ease into blueprint designing at your pace, and expand your toolkit (and size of designs) as you progress!  

*Important note:*  
*Blueprint designs can only be loaded back into same size blueprinter. But you can build them into larger one if needed.*


**Known issue**: The blueprints cannot be loaded into 1x1 - 3x3 blueprinters. For some reason game thinks they are 4x4. Workaround: Select the blueprint and build it inside the blueprinter.


### Tier 1 - 1x1x1 foundations

*Requires: The Pioneer to show they can gather a full stack of every basic material*

Miniprinting.  
Recommended construction: Anti-wildlife bunker.

We are not supposed to give you this technology YET, but there is a reason Fix-It Tools users consistently place in the top five percentile. Go Wild!

P.S. Did you know your build tool sampling mode can sample multiple objects at once? It just needs a frame of reference to tell what is grouped together. This is the Frame Of Reference.

### Tier 2 - 2x2x2 foundations

*Requires: Tier 1 blueprinter unlocked.*

Small factor blueprinting - ideal for decorations.

### Tallprinter (Tier 5)

Why does it look like somebody stacked four regular blueprinters? Because that is what we did.
It is very tall.

Yes, you can fit the radar tower in.

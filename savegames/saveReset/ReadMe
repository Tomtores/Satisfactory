What does it do:
Transplant script to copy over things from your old save to new one. When you want a fresh start.
Copied:
- Total playtime (save menu display + ingame counter)
- vehicle paths [not implemented yet]
- swatches [not implemented yet]
- awesome sink point progress [not implemented yet] (basically, you keep current difficulty of progression. Otherwise new save starts with at 0 points and veeeery cheap tickets)

Prerequisities:

Download Grehak save parser from https://github.com/GreyHak/sat_sav_parse

Drop the TRANSPLANT.py into same folder
Place your SOURCE (legacy savegame) and TARGET (new savegame where you just landed) in the same folder for simplicity

Run `python TRANSPLANT.py SOURCE TARGET --playtime`
Result will be saved as `TARGET_Edited.sav`
Temporary files are stored in temp folder. You can delete them after work is done.
If you want to check if the properties are transferred correctly, run the script once without any parameters (just source and target) to execute resave with no changes and store a copy of TARGET.json, then run the script again with parameter enabled and compare newly generated TARGET.json to previous copy.

## Halflings have arrived!

Do you build railways in half-pipe tunnels, but cannot place signals easily, because they stick out through the ceiling?  
With this mod you can easily build half sized Block and Path Signals, for your tunnel needs.
Also allows creation of half-sized ceiling lights**.

![Command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tomtores/Satisfactory/refs/heads/main/Halflings/SiteDocs/signalsenabled.png)

Use the chat command: `/halflings on`  
This will enter the "Halfling Mode" and all Block and Path signals will be built in half size.  
To return to normal building, type `/halflings off`.

All signals built with this mod are vanilla game objects scaled down (think MicroManage), and will remain ingame after removing the mod.
The holograms are currently broken, with no promise of fix (known issue).
Please note that sampling rail and switching to signal, will build the signal at original size. You have to select signal from build menu or hotbar (known issue). Same thing for sampling floodlight and switching to light pole.

## Lights

### Known Issues:
- The hologram is displayed wrong -> I have not found a way to put it in "correct" place. The signal will be built correctly though.
- **Half sized ceiling lights work only when SMART is not installed. Due to how SMART overrides holograms, small ceiling lights do not work when that mod is enabled.
- Sampling a rail and switching to signal builds signal in original size instead of small. -> Select signal from build menu or hotbar.
- Sampling floodlight and switching to light pole builds in original size instead of small. -> Select light pole from build menu or hotbar.
- **Experimental 1.1** Left-handed rail signals are built in middle of the track -> need to fix the offset, no ETA. Please use right handed signals.

### Feedback:
I have play-tested the mod with no visible issues.
It should not affect any other objects beside the railway signals, or crash the game, but please save before you start using it.  
If you spot any issues - let me know.

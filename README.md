For support, find me at Satisfactory Modding discord as `Tomtores#8952`.

Please note that ProgressiveBlueprinters and Megaprinters use base game blueprint machine and contain no custom code. For this reason, bugs related to blueprint functionality itself are most likely base game issues that I have no influence over. Please check if the same error happens in the vanilla game machines before reporting a bug.
